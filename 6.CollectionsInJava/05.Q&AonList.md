### 1: Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?

ArrayList: Backed by array, fast random access, slow insertion in middle.
LinkedList: Backed by nodes, fast insertion/removal, slow random access.

### 2: How does ArrayList grow internally?

Default capacity = 10.
When full, grows by 50% (new capacity = old + old/2).

### 3. How to make a List thread-safe?

Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>());

 or CopyOnWriteArrayList.
