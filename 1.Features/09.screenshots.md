## screenshots

screenshot is an image capture of the current state of the browser window during test execution.
Selenium can capture:

the **entire visible page**

a **specific element**

the **full page** (with additional libraries)

Screenshots serve as evidence, debugging tools, and reporting materials for test automation.

## Why Screenshots Are Important
### 1. Debugging Test Failures

If a test fails due to:

element not visible

incorrect UI rendering

unexpected popups
You can verify what was actually shown on the screen at the moment of failure.

### 2. Reporting

Tools like:

Extent Reports

Allure

TestNG/JUnit reports

Use screenshots to visually show test steps.

### 3. CI/CD Monitoring

When tests run on pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), screenshots help diagnose failures without physically seeing the test.

### 4. Visual Validation

Screenshots help verify layout consistency or UI bugs.

## Capturing a Screenshot — Full Page (Viewport)

```
File src = ((TakesScreenshot) driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
File dest = new File("screenshots/page.png");
FileHandler.copy(src, dest);
```

OUTPUT types:

OutputType.FILE → returns as a File object

OutputType.BYTES → returns as byte[]

OutputType.BASE64 → returns base64 string

## Capturing an Element Screenshot

Most people don't know Selenium supports element-specific screenshots.
```
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("logo"));
File src = element.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileHandler.copy(src, new File("screenshots/logo.png"));
```

## Capturing Full-Page Screenshot (Beyond Viewport)

Selenium by itself cannot capture "scrolling full page" screenshots in all browsers.

**Supported only by Firefox natively:**
```
File src = ((FirefoxDriver) driver).getFullPageScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
```

For Chrome, you need:
✔ AShot library
✔ DevTools protocol (Selenium 4+)
